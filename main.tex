\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}

Brillouin scattering is the inelastic scattering of light from acoustic phonons. Spontaneous Brillouin scattering is light scattering specifically with the thermodynamic fluctuations in a material. Sufficient optical power elevates this spontaneous process into stimulated Brillouin scattering: a regime in which the optical fields augment the optical properties of the material, greatly enhancing the optomechanical response. This occurs as the backscattered (e.g. Stokes) light beats with the incident pump light to induce an electrostrictive modulation that reinforces the acoustic phonons in the material. It would be desirable to introduce a high-powered fourth optical field dedicated to electrostrictive reinforcement, further stimulating the acoustic field, however phase matching conditions require that its frequency and wavevector be identical to that of the backscattered light, preventing distinguishability.

[paragraph describing current state of the art methods from literature]

In this work, we present a coherently stimulated Brillouin spectrometer that utilizes a detuned pump-probe design to perform traveling-wave phonon spectroscopy at scales previously unachievable with traditional stimulated Brillouin techniques. With this method, we achieve sub-10 femtowatt sensitivity and enable room temperature traveling-wave phonon spectroscopy at the micrometer scale. We demonstrate the capabilities of the instrument by observing Brillouin scattering at room temperature in 1 centimeter of UHNA3 fiber and 100 micrometers of bulk carbon disulfide liquid. This instrument opens the door to nanometer-scale Brillouin spectroscopy with usage of higher optical powers and enables the characterization and development of novel nano-acousto-optic devices.


\section{Theoretical Framework}
\label{Theoretical Framework}

\subsection*{Coherently stimulated four-wave Brillouin scattering}
\label{Theoretical Framework:Coherently stimulated five-wave Brillouin scattering}
Stimulated Brillouin scattering, illustrated by the schematic in Fig. \ref{fig:4-Wave-Brillouin-Scattering}(a) for the Stokes process, is a three-wave mixing process in which incident pump laser light of frequency $\omega_{Pump}$ inelastically scatters from a traveling-wave phonon of frequency $\Omega$ to produce light that is frequency-shifted by the phonon frequency. In the Stokes process the phonon is retreating from the incident laser light and the scattered light is shifted down in frequency ($\omega_{Stokes} = \omega_{Pump} - \Omega$). Light scattered in the backwards direction spatially overlaps with the incident laser light, allowing the two optical fields interfere to produce a frequency at the difference between the two ($\omega_{Pump} - \omega_{Stokes}$). Since this difference frequency is exactly equal to the frequency of the acoustic field $\Omega$, the beating of the incident pump light and the backscattered Stokes light produces an electrostrictive reinforcement of the acoustic wave. This driving of the acoustic wave in turn increases the scattering rate of the incident pump light, producing a positive feedback process and an exponential increase of the amplitude of the backscattered Stokes wave.

\begin{figure*}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{4-Wave-Brillouin-Scattering.pdf}
  \caption{Illustration of 4-Wave Brillouin Scattering. [stand-in figure]}
  \label{fig:4-Wave-Brillouin-Scattering}
\end{figure*}

Fig. \ref{fig:4-Wave-Brillouin-Scattering}(b) shows the schematic of coherently stimulated four-wave Brillouin scattering for the Stokes process. We introduce a dedicated external Stokes laser of frequency $\omega_{Stokes}$ that strongly drives the electrostrictive reinforcement of the acoustic field in the material. The backscattered Stokes light which is normally collected in an SBS process to infer mechanical properties of the material is now drowned out by the much higher power external Stokes laser. To resolve this, we introduce an additional external laser at a distinct frequency $\omega_{Probe}$ which copropagates with the pump laser and backscatters in the material from the strongly driven acoustic field. This produces a backscattered signal to be collected ($\omega_{Signal} = \omega_{Probe} - \Omega$) which is distinguishable from the high-powered Stokes laser light.

A full derivation of the coupled-wave equations for this four-wave mixing process can be found in Appendix \ref{Appendix:Coupled-Wave Equations}, where the scattered power of the backscattered signal is shown to be
\\
\begin{equation}
  P_{Signal} = \frac{1}{4}(G_{B}L)^{2}P_{Pump}P_{Stokes}P_{Probe}sinc^{2}\left(\frac{\Delta kL}{2}\right),
  \label{Eq:Theoretical Framework:Scattered Power} %compress sinc term into Psi here?
\end{equation}
\\
where $G_{B}$ is the coherently stimulated Brillouin scattering gain factor,
\\
\begin{equation}
  G_{B} = g_{0}\frac{\left(\frac{\Gamma_{B}}{2}\right)^{2}}{(\Omega - \Omega_{B})^{2} + \left(\frac{\Gamma_{B}}{2}\right)^{2}},
\end{equation}
\\
with the on-resonance gain factor of the material given by
\\
\begin{equation}
  g_{0} = \left[\frac{\epsilon_{0}^{2}\omega^{2}q^{4}\gamma_{e}^{4}}{n^{2}c^{2}\rho_{0}^{2}}\right].
\end{equation}
Here, $q$ is the wavevector of the driven acoustic field, $\gamma_{e}$ is the electrostrictive constant, $n$ is the refractive index of the material, $\rho_{0}$ is the mean density of the material, $\Omega_{B}$ is the resonant Brillouin frequency of the material, $\Gamma_{B}$ is the Brillouin linewidth, or dissipation rate, of the material, and $\Delta k$ is the wavevector mismatch between the optical fields, to be discussed next.


\subsection*{Phase matching relaxation}
\label{Theoretical Framework: Phase matching relaxation}
In all nonlinear optical processes, efficiency is maximized when phase matching conditions are satisfied. A frequency mismatch (energy unconservation) or a wavevector mismatch (momentum unconservation) each result in drastically reduced efficiency of a given process.\cite{maker1962effects} This can be seen by Eq. \ref{Eq:Theoretical Framework:Scattered Power}, where the wavevector mismatch, $\Delta k$, is contained within a $sinc^{2}$ function. This $sinc^{2}$ term thereby defines the phase matching bandwidth of the system, notably scaling with effective interaction length $L$.

We apply this wavevector mismatch allowance to the pump and probe waves ($\Delta k = k_{Pump} - k_{Probe}$) so that the backscattered signal is different than the applied Stokes wave. This choice allows for selection of the signal and rejection of the Stokes with a bandpass filter. Expressed in terms of wavelengths, this gives
\\
\begin{equation}
  \Delta k = \frac{4\pi n\Delta\lambda}{\lambda_{Pump}\lambda_{Probe}} \approx \frac{4\pi n\Delta\lambda}{\lambda_{Pump}^{2}}.
\end{equation}
\\
We can apply this to the phasematching bandwidth term to find the fraction of maximum scattered power, $\Phi$, that can be expected for a given $L$ and phase mismatch $\Delta\lambda$ between the pump and probe,
\\
\begin{equation}
  \Phi \equiv sinc^{2}\left(\frac{2\pi n\Delta\lambda L}{\lambda_{Pump}^{2}}\right).
\end{equation}
\\
Using this expression for $\Phi$, we see that for an effective length of one meter a wavelength mismatch of only 0.6 pm from 1.55 $\mu$m pump light in UHNA3 fiber drops the scattered power to one half of maximum. However, for shorter effective lengths the wavevector mismatch becomes more forgiving; a 36 pm mismatch preserves 82.5\% of the maximum signal for a length of 1 cm and all else equal. This separation, translating to about  4.5 GHz, is meaningful, as it represents sufficient spectral separation for the backscattered signal to be isolated from the applied Stokes light.




\section{Methods}\label{Methods}
\subsection*{Instrument design}
\label{Methods:Instrument Design}

\begin{figure*}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Instrument-Design-V1.pdf}
\caption{Instrument design diagram}
\label{fig:Instrument Design}
\end{figure*}

The design of the instrument is shown in the schematic in Fig. \ref{fig:Instrument Design}. A pump and Stokes signal is synthesized from a single tunable laser source for coherent stimulation of the sample. The pump signal ($\omega_{Pump}$) is amplified by an erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) and passed through a variable optical attenuator (VOA) for power control. The output is then polarization-controlled to reflect at a polarizing beam splitter (PBS) for injection into the sample. For Stokes synthesis, an AC signal ($\Omega$) is supplied to an intensity modulator with carrier frequency nulled and a tunable filter is used to select one side band output ($\omega_{Pump} - \Omega$). This Stokes light is then amplified by an EDFA, passed through a VOA, and polarization-controlled to reflect at a second PBS for couter-propagation to the pump through the sample.

A separate tunable laser ($\omega_{Probe} = \omega_{Pump} + \Delta k$) is used to synthesize the probe and local oscillator (LO). Probe light is amplified by an EDFA and fed through a VOA. A polarization controller aligns the polarization axis of the probe light for transmission through the first PBS and copropagation with the pump into the sample. Backscattered probe light exits the sample and transmits back through the first PBS, whereas the orthogonally polarized Stokes light reflects at this same point to be diverted to a tap for power monitoring. The backscattered signal ($\omega_{Signal} = \omega_{Probe} + \Omega$) then routes through two subsequent circulators for spectral filtering by a 5 GHz bandpass tunable filter. This filter allows the frequency-shifted probe light to pass while rejecting (1) any reflected probe light, and (2) any reflected, transmitted, or backscattered pump or Stokes light that was not already diverted by the PBS.

The filtered signal heterodynes via a 99-1 splitter with the LO ($\omega_{LO} = \omega_{Probe} + \omega_{AOM}$), which has been frequency-upshifted 40 MHz by an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) and controlled to be copolarized with the backscattered signal. We consider only the subtracted frequency term of the heterodyne process as all others are beyond the range of detection. This heterodyned signal ($\omega_{signal} = \Omega + \omega_{AOM}$) is then captured by a photodiode detector and heterodyned again by a radio frequency (RF) mixer with a second AC signal ($\Omega + \omega_{AOM} - \omega_{Lock}$), where $\omega_{Lock}$ is a constant frequency under 50 MHz that the lock-in amplifier is set to read (typically 45 MHz). $\omega_{Lock}$ is passed through a 50 MHz low-pass filter, amplified with an RF amplifier, and finally supplied to the lock-in amplifier for data collection. $\omega_{Lock}$ remains constant because both AC signals involve $\Omega$ and sweep syncronously through the range under measurement.


\section{Results}\label{Results}
\subsection*{Instrument sensitivity and SBS comparison}
\label{Results:Instrument sensitivity and SBS comparison}

[Not sure if sensitivity is relevant/should be included]

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{5fWSensitivity.pdf}
  \caption{~5 fW sensitivity measurement}
  \label{fig:10fWSensitivity}
\end{figure}

We begin by testing the sensitivity of the instrument as a way of defining a performance metric for the instrument. As well, this figure will serve to inform all future measurements by indicating what material, power, and length combinations might be possible to measure. From Eq. \ref{Eq:Theoretical Framework:Scattered Power}, the sensitivity of the instrument is the minimum scattered power, $P_{Signal}$, to produce a statistically significant measurement. To determine this, we use a sample of known effective Brillouin gain, $g_{0}$, and target a specific length, $L$. We keep the pump-probe detuning, $\Delta\lambda$, constant and record the pump, Stokes, and probe optical powers to calculate the scattered power. Starting with sufficient optical powers to produce a clearly distinguishable measurement, we gradually reduce the optical powers until the sensitivity floor is reached.

We prepared a length of 1 cm of Nufern's UHNA3 fiber to serve as our sensitivity testbed. The properties of UHNA3 fiber are well known and favorable for unambiguous detection of the Brillouin signal. First, it offers a Brillouin shift that is spectrally far from that of the single-mode fiber (SMF28) that constitutes much of our instrument. Additionally, due to its high germanium concentration in the core, UHNA3 fiber has a large refractive index difference between core and cladding, producing exceptionally high optical and acoustic guidance. Finally, UHNA3 fiber offers a high optomechanical nonlinear response; the Brillouin gain of UHNA3 fiber is approximately 0.6 $W^{-1}m^{-1}$ at room temperature\cite{behunin2015long}, which is about an order of magnitude larger than that of SMF28\cite{nikles1997brillouin}.

Fig. \ref{fig:10fWSensitivity} shows the Brillouin signal for a sensitivity of $P_{Signal}$ = [5]\,fW. We find the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of this measurement to be [>5], determined by taking the ratio of the peak spectral density at the center frequency (9.18 GHz) and the standard error in the spectral density completely off resonance. Assuming a normal noise distrubution profile, an SNR of [5] is equivalent to a [5]$\sigma$ confidence interval, or 99.7\% confidence in the statistical significance of this measurement. Parameters for this measurement and calculation of scattered power are listed in Table \ref{tab:sensitivity}.

\end{table}

The low optical powers required to obtain a measurement of just 1 cm of UHNA3 fiber illustrates the supremacy of the instrument over traditional SBS. An SBS measurement of 1 cm of UHNA3 fiber would require [depends on g0] W of pump power to achieve the same scattered power.

\subsection*{Measurements}
\label{Results:Measurements}

We consider two sample types to test the capabilities of the instrument, one fiber-coupled and one bulk material. For a fiber-coupled measurement we again choose UHNA3 fiber for its higher nonlinear response and excellent optical and acoustic guidance. In contrast to the sensitivity measurements, we now apply all available optical power (about 1.5 W) to maximize the backscattered signal from the sample, using the same 1 cm segment of UHNA3 fiber as the target.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{1cmUHNA3.pdf}
  \caption{1cm UHNA3}
  \label{fig:1cmUHNA3}
\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{fig:1cmUHNA3} shows the spectral profile captured for 1 cm of UHNA3 fiber, revealing the expected lorentzian profile. The center frequency indicates the Brillouin resonance frequency of the longitudinal mode in the fiber and the FWHM indicates the dissipation rate. The center frequency of 9.18 GHz and the FWHM of approximately 80 MHz match what is seen in the literature.\cite{behunin2015long} The data shown are a background-subtracted average of five successive measurements taken over 10 minutes and the error bars correspond to $1\sigma$ of the standard deviation of the mean, or standard error.

To achieve this measurement of UHNA3 fiber, the instrument design was altered to include only fiber-coupled segments connecting the fiber ports between the two PBSs. The pump laser wavelength was set to 1549.000 nm and the probe laser wavelength was set to 1549.020 nm, giving a frequency mismatch of approximately 2.5 GHz. The pump-probe mismatch is chosen to be only as large as needed to allow the edge of the pass-band of the probe filter to split the backscattered pump and probe light, thus rejecting any backscattered light from the pump laser and accepting only the backscattered signal from the probe laser. The Stokes filter was placed at 1549.073 nm, an offet of approximately 9.18 GHz from the pump laser to capture the Stokes sideband from the intensity modulator. This corresponds to the center of the measured frequency range and was chosen to allow the Stokes sideband output from the intensity modulator to remain within the pass band of the Stokes filter as the RF signal fed to the intensity modulator is swept through the full measurement range. The probe filter was set to 1549.109 nm, an offset of approximately 11.18 GHz from the probe laser, to capture the Stokes-shifted backscattered signal from the probe. The center frequency of the backscattered signal is of course shifted 9.18 GHz from the probe laser, however an extra offset of 2 GHz is chosen for improved rejection of any pump light as the pass band of our filter extends approximately 2.5 GHz on either side of center.

For the UHNA3 measurement shown as well as for all typical measurements, the pump laser emits approximately 45 mW of power, of which 10\% is split and amplified to approximately 0.5 W to become the pump optical field. The other 90\% emitted from the pump laser is shifted to become the Stokes optical field and is amplified to approximately 1 W. Similarly, the probe laser emits approximately 45 mW of power, of which 10\% is split and amplified to approximately 1 W to become the probe optical field and the remaining 90\% is used as the LO. To minimize loss to the backscattered signal before being collected by the detector, a 99/1 splitter is used to heterodyne the signal and LO, preserving 99\% of the signal power and 1\% of the LO power. To compensate for this, The LO is amplified to approximately 230 mW prior to combining with the signal, resulting in the maximum allowable input power for our detector of <2.4 mW incident at the detector. Post-detector, the electronic signal is amplified by a 23 dbm RF amplifier and finally inserted into the lock-in amplifier. For all measurements, it was found that setting both pump and probe lasers to emit in whisper mode (as opposed to dither) dramatically improved the spectral density and SNR of the signal recieved by the lock-in amplifier.

The signal input and demodulator settings of our Zurich Instruments HF2LI 50 MHz lock-in amplifier have been found to be critical for maximizing the SNR of the measurement. First, clock timing is synced between the signal generater and the lock-in with a 10 MHz reference signal output from the signal generator and fed into the lock-in. The range, which defines the gain of the analog input amplifier, should exceed the incoming signal by roughly a factor two including a potential DC offset. This is best chosen by selecting the auto feature within the lock-in software interface, which automatically adjusts the range according to a rolling 100 ms window of the maximum measured input signal amplitude. The coupling mode is set to AC which inserts a high-pass filter that rejects DC components of the input signal. The input impedance is toggled to high, stated as approximately 1M$\Omega$. We set the low-pass filter order to the 8th order, which sets the filter to roll off at the maximum 48 dB/oct. Data collection of the input signal is set to the maximum 1.84 million Sa/s.

We find that the input signal drifts less than 100 Hz after all components of the system reach equilibrium temperature (around 30 minutes). We are thus typically able to set the low pass filter bandwidth to 100 Hz without our signal drifting outside of this range even for long measurements of a few hours. For short measurements of less than 15 minutes this bandwidth can typically be reduced to as little as 40 Hz without risk of the signal drifting out of range. To achieve this precision of the signal input to the lock-in, $\omega_{Lock}$, requires that the frequency difference between the two output signals of the signal generator, $\omega_{Ch1} = \Omega$ and $\omega_{Ch2} = \Omega - \omega_{Lock} + \omega_{AOM}$, be set at least as precisely. While $\Omega$ is directly controlled to subhertz precision by the signal generator, $\omega_{AOM}$ varies according to the precision of our AOM device. Our AOM has been found to shift its input signal very close to exactly its specified 40 MHz initially but then gradually increase this shift as the device warms to equilibrium operating temperature over about 35 minutes. At thermal equilibrium, the device is found to shift the signal by approximately 40,000,820 Hz $\pm$ 50 Hz. This was found to be the case despite proper thermal grounding of the device.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{100umCS2.pdf}
  \caption{100$\mu$m CS2}
  \label{fig:100umCS2}
\end{figure}

For a free-space bulk example we target carbon disulfide liquid for its exceptionally high Brillouin gain factor of 1.5 m/GW.\cite{boyd2020nonlinear} Figure \ref{fig:100umCS2} reveals the Brillouin signal of carbon disulfide liquid contained in a 100 $\mu$m path length cell. To our knowledge, measurement of Brillouin scattering at this scale has not been reported in the literature. A scattered power comparison would reveal that achieving such a measurement using traditional SBS techniques would require excessively high optical powers or cooling the material to cryogenic temperatures, which, of course, would be prohibitive for carbon disulfide in the liquid state.

For this measurement of carbon disulfide, the pump and probe laser wavelengths were set to 1548.808 nm and 1548.898 nm, respectively. The short path length of the sample significantly broadens $\Phi$, the $sinc^{2}$ term defining the phasematching bandwidth, allowing for further separation of the pump and probe wavelengths for improved signal isolation without significant reduction in scattered power of the signal produced in the carbon disulfide. Specifically, the additional pump-probe wavelength separation of 70 pm employed for this measurement compared to the UHNA3 measurement results in a negligible 0.045\% reduction in scattered power. This additional separation contributes meaningfully, however, to improved rejection of pump light by the probe filter and thus higher SNR of the signal.

Placement of the Stokes filter is critical for measurements of materials that give small Brillouin shifts, such as with carbon disulfide's 2.55 GHz shift. We offset our 5GHz bandwidth Stokes filter an additional 2 GHz to ensure the nearby carrier signal and anti-Stokes sideband from the intensity modulator are rejected and only the Stokes sideband is allowed to pass. For the measurement shown in Fig. \ref{fig:100umCS2}, this corresponds to a Stokes  and probe filter placement of 1548.844 nm and 1548.934 nm, respectively.

Figure , clearly displays the Brillouin scattering features with remarkable SNR, highlighting the effectiveness of our apparatus in isolating the backscattered probe light. This observation serves as one of the main showcases of the instrument's capability.

This successful measurement in a bulk sample demonstrates the versatility and adaptability of our instrument to various experimental configurations, further emphasizing the instrument's capability.

% Lastly, we conducted a measurement in a 1-millimeter-long UHNA3 fiber under low-power conditions, with only 10 microwatts of power at the sample. Despite the reduced sample length and low power, the instrument's sensitivity allowed us to observe distinct Brillouin scattering features in the spectrum, as illustrated in Figure 3. This result underscores the potential of our spectrometer for nanoscale measurements and serves as a demonstration of the instrument's sensitivity, defining the sensitivity floor of the apparatus.

    \tilde{E}_{Pr}(z,t) = A_{Pr}e^{i(k_{Pr}z - \omega_{Pr}t)} + c.c.
    \label{eq:Probe optical field}
\end{equation}
\\
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{E}_{Sig}(z,t) = A_{Sig}e^{i(k_{Sig}z - \omega_{Sig}t)} + c.c.
    \label{eq:Signal optical field}
\end{equation}
\\
\noindent and a common acoustic field given by
\\
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{\rho}(z,t) = \rho_{0} + \rho(z,t)e^{i(qz - \Omega t)} + c.c.,
    \label{eq:acoustic field}
\end{equation}
\\
\noindent where $\Omega = \omega_{P} - \omega_{S}$ and $q = k_{P} - k_{S} = 2k_{P}$.


\subsection{Acoustic Field}
\label{Coupled-Wave Equations:Acoustic Field}

As in the case of SBS \cite{boyd2020nonlinear}, we start by assuming that the material obeys the acoustic wave equation,
\\
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial^{2}\tilde{\rho}}{\partial t^{2}} - \Gamma^{\prime}\nabla^{2}\frac{\partial\tilde{\rho}}{\partial t} - v^{2}\nabla^{2}\tilde{\rho} = \nabla\cdot\vec{f},
    \label{eq:acoustic wave equation}
\end{equation}
\\
\noindent where $v$ is the sound speed in the material and $\Gamma^{\prime}$ is a damping parameter given by
\\
\begin{equation}
    \Gamma^{\prime} = \frac{1}{\rho}\left[\frac{4}{3}\eta_{s} + \eta_{b} + \frac{\kappa}{C_{p}}(\gamma - 1)\right],
\end{equation}
\\
\noindent where $\eta_{s}$ and $\eta_{b}$ are the shear and bulk viscosity coefficients of the material, respectively. The source term on the right side of Eq. (\ref{eq:acoustic wave equation}) is the divergence of the electrostrictive force:
\\
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    \vec{f} = \nabla p_{st} = \nabla \cdot \Bigg[-\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_{0}\gamma_{e}\Big(&\langle\tilde{E}_{P} \cdot \tilde{E}_{S}\rangle \\
    &+ \langle\tilde{E}_{Pr} \cdot \tilde{E}_{Sig}\rangle\Big)\Bigg],
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\\
which yields, after applying the slowly varying amplitude approximation,
\\
\begin{equation}
    \nabla\cdot\vec{f} = \epsilon_{0}\gamma_{e}q^{2}(A_{P}A_{S}^{*} + A_{Pr}A_{Sig}^{*}e^{i\Delta kz}),
\end{equation}
\\
Where $\Delta k = (k_{Pr} - k_{Sig}) - (k_{P} - k_{S})$ is the phase mismatch between the four optical fields. Only two electrostrictive terms survive terms after accounting for the orthogonal polarization of the pump and Stokes fields with respect to that of the probe and backscattered signal. Inserting this electrostrictive force term and the acoustic field (Eq. (\ref{eq:acoustic field})) into Eq. (\ref{eq:acoustic wave equation}) and assuming a slowly varying acoustic amplitude we find
\\
\begin{equation}
    -2i\Omega\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} - \Gamma^{\prime}2iq^{2}\Omega\rho - 2iqv^{2}\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial z} = \epsilon_{0}\gamma_{e}q^{2}(A_{P}A_{S}^{*} + A_{Pr}A_{Sig}^{*}e^{i\Delta kz}),
\end{equation}
\\
which can be restated in terms of the Brillouin linewidth, $\Gamma_{B} = q^{2}\Gamma^{\prime}$, as
\\
\begin{equation}
    -2i\Omega\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} - 2i\Omega\Gamma_{B}\rho - 2iqv^{2}\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial z} = \epsilon_{0}\gamma_{e}q^{2}(A_{P}A_{S}^{*} + A_{Pr}A_{Sig}^{*}e^{i\Delta kz}).
    \label{eq:in terms of Brillouin linewidth}
\end{equation}
\\
Given the phonon dispersion relations $\Omega_{B} = |q_{B}|v$ and $\Omega^{2} = q^{2}\left(v^{2} - i\Omega\Gamma^{\prime}\right)$, Eq. (\ref{eq:in terms of Brillouin linewidth}) can be rewritten as
\\
\begin{equation}
    -2i\Omega\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} + \left(\Omega^{2} - \Omega^{2} - i\Omega\Gamma_{B}\right)\rho - 2iqv^{2}\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial z} = \epsilon_{0}\gamma_{e}q^{2}(A_{P}A_{S}^{*} + A_{Pr}A_{Sig}^{*}e^{i\Delta kz}).
    \label{eq:in terms of Omega_B}
\end{equation}
\\
We take the common assumption that the phonon propagation distance is small compared to the distance over which the source term varies significantly, which allows the spatial derivative term in Eq. (\ref{eq:in terms of Omega_B}). We further assume steady-state conditions such that the time derivative term also vanishes, leaving
\\
\begin{equation}
    (\Omega^{2}_{B} - \Omega^{2} - i\Omega\Gamma_{B})_{\rho} = \epsilon_{0}\gamma_{e}q^{2}(A_{P}A_{S}^{*} + A_{Pr}A_{Sig}^{*}e^{i\Delta kz}).
\end{equation}
\\
We thus find the acoustic field amplitude to be
\\
\begin{equation}
    \rho(z,t) = \epsilon_{0}\gamma_{e}q^{2}\frac{A_{P}A_{S}^{*} + A_{Pr}A_{Sig}^{*}e^{i\Delta kz}}{\Omega_{B}^{2} - \Omega^{2} - i\Omega\Gamma_{B}}.
    \label{eq:Acoustic field amplitude}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Optical Fields}
\label{Coupled-Wave Equations:Optical Fields}

We now turn to the spatial evolution of the optical fields, described by the wave equation,
\\
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial^{2}\tilde{E}_{i}}{\partial z^{2}} - \frac{n^{2}}{c^{2}}\frac{\partial^{2}\tilde{E}_{i}}{\partial t^{2}} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_{0}c^{2}}\frac{\partial^{2}\tilde{P}_{i}}{\partial t^{2}},
    \label{eq:Wave equation}
\end{equation}
\\
where i denotes the four optical fields, namely: pump, Stokes, probe, and backscattered signal. The total nonlinear polarization that gives rise to the source term in the wave equation is given by
\\
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{P} = \epsilon_{0}\Delta\chi\tilde{E} = \epsilon_{0}\Delta\epsilon\tilde{E} = \epsilon_{0}\rho^{-1}\gamma_{e}\tilde{\rho}\tilde{E}.
\end{equation}
\\
The parts of $\tilde{P}$ that can act as phase-matched source terms for the optical fields are
\\
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{P}_{P} = p_{P}e^{i(k_{P}z - \omega_{P} t)} + c.c. = \frac{1}{2}\epsilon_{0}\rho_{0}^{-1}\gamma_{e}\rho A_{S}e^{i(k_{P}z - \omega_{P} t)}
    \label{eq:Pump phase-matched source term}
\end{equation}
\\
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{P}_{S} = p_{S}e^{i(-k_{S}z - \omega_{S} t)} + c.c. = \frac{1}{2}\epsilon_{0}\rho_{0}^{-1}\gamma_{e}\rho^{*} A_{P}e^{i(-k_{S}z - \omega_{S} t)}
    \label{eq:Stokes phase-matched source term}
\end{equation}
\\
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{P}_{Pr} = p_{Pr}e^{i(k_{Pr}z - \omega_{Pr} t)} + c.c. = \frac{1}{2}\epsilon_{0}\rho_{0}^{-1}\gamma_{e}\rho A_{Sig}e^{i(k_{Pr}z - \omega_{Pr} t)}e^{i\Delta kz}
    \label{eq:Probe phase-matched source term}
\end{equation}
\\
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{P}_{Sig} = p_{Sig}e^{i(-k_{Sig}z - \omega_{Sig} t)} + c.c. = \frac{1}{2}\epsilon_{0}\rho_{0}^{-1}\gamma_{e}\rho^{*} A_{Pr}e^{i(-k_{Sig}z - \omega_{Sig} t)}e^{-i\Delta kz}.
    \label{eq:Signal phase-matched source term}
\end{equation}
\\
Inserting the optical fields (Eqs. \ref{eq:Pump optical field}-\ref{eq:Signal optical field}) and phase-matched source terms (Eqs. \ref{eq:Pump phase-matched source term}-\ref{eq:Signal phase-matched source term}) into Eq. (\ref{eq:Wave equation}), we obtain
\\
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial A_{P}}{\partial z} + \frac{n}{c}\frac{\partial A_{P}}{\partial t} = \frac{i\omega_{P}\gamma_{e}}{2nc\rho_{0}}\rho A_{2}
\end{equation}
\\
\begin{equation}
    -\frac{\partial A_{S}}{\partial z} + \frac{n}{c}\frac{\partial A_{S}}{\partial t} = \frac{i\omega_{S}\gamma_{e}}{2nc\rho_{0}}\rho^{*}A_{P}
\end{equation}
\\
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial A_{Pr}}{\partial z} + \frac{n}{c}\frac{\partial A_{Pr}}{\partial t} = \frac{i\omega_{Pr}\gamma_{e}}{2nc\rho_{0}}\rho A_{Sig}
\end{equation}
\\
\begin{equation}
    -\frac{\partial A_{Sig}}{\partial z} + \frac{n}{c}\frac{\partial A_{Sig}}{\partial t} = \frac{i\omega_{Sig}\gamma_{e}}{2nc\rho_{0}}\rho^{*}A_{Pr}
\end{equation}
\\
We again assume steady-state conditions, allowing the time derivative term to be dropped. Plugging in the acoustic field amplitude (Eq. \ref{eq:Acoustic field amplitude}), we arrive at the coupled-amplitude wave equations for the optical fields,
\\
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial A_{P}}{\partial z} = \frac{i\epsilon_{0}\omega_{P} q^{2}\gamma_{e}^{2}}{2nc\rho_{0}}\frac{A_{P}|A_{S}|^{2} + A_{Pr}A_{Sig}^{*}A_{S}e^{i\Delta kz}}{\Omega_{B}^{2} - \Omega^{2} - i\Omega\Gamma_{B}}
\end{equation}
\\
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial A_{S}}{\partial z} = -\frac{i\epsilon_{0}\omega_{S} q^{2}\gamma_{e}^{2}}{2nc\rho_{0}}\frac{|A_{P}|^{2}A_{S}^{*} + A_{Pr}A_{Sig}^{*}A_{P}e^{-i\Delta kz}}{\Omega_{B}^{2} - \Omega^{2} + i\Omega\Gamma_{B}}
\end{equation}
\\
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial A_{Pr}}{\partial z} = \frac{i\epsilon_{0}\omega_{Pr} q^{2}\gamma_{e}^{2}}{2nc\rho_{0}}\frac{A_{P}A_{S}^{*}A_{Sig} + A_{Pr}|A_{Sig}|^{2}e^{i\Delta kz}}{\Omega_{B}^{2} - \Omega^{2} - i\Omega\Gamma_{B}}
\end{equation}
\\
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial A_{Sig}}{\partial z} = -\frac{i\epsilon_{0}\omega_{Sig} q^{2}\gamma_{e}^{2}}{2nc\rho_{0}}\frac{A_{P}A_{S}^{*}A_{Pr} + |A_{Pr}|^{2}A_{Sig}^{*}e^{-i\Delta kz}}{\Omega_{B}^{2} - \Omega^{2} + i\Omega\Gamma_{B}}
    \label{eq:Signal coupled-amplitude wave equation}
\end{equation}
\\
Integrating Eq. \ref{eq:Signal coupled-amplitude wave equation} along the effective length gives the amplitudes of each optical field,
\\
\begin{equation}
  A_{P} = \frac{i\epsilon_{0}\omega_{P}q^{2}\gamma_{e}^{2}}{2nc\rho_{0}}\frac{A_{P}|A_{S}|^{2} + A_{Pr}A_{Sig}^{*}A_{S}}{\Omega_{B}^{2} - \Omega^{2} - i\Omega\Gamma_{B}} \frac{e^{i\Delta kL} - 1}{i\Delta k},
\end{equation}
\\
\begin{equation}
  A_{S} = -\frac{i\epsilon_{0}\omega_{S}q^{2}\gamma_{e}^{2}}{2nc\rho_{0}}\frac{|A_{P}|^{2}A_{S}^{*} + A_{Pr}A_{Sig}^{*}A_{P}}{\Omega_{B}^{2} - \Omega^{2} + i\Omega\Gamma_{B}} \frac{e^{-i\Delta kL} - 1}{-i\Delta k},
\end{equation}
\\
\begin{equation}
  A_{Pr} = \frac{i\epsilon_{0}\omega_{Pr}q^{2}\gamma_{e}^{2}}{2nc\rho_{0}}\frac{A_{P}A_{S}^{*}A_{Sig} + A_{Pr}|A_{Sig}|^{2}}{\Omega_{B}^{2} - \Omega^{2} - i\Omega\Gamma_{B}} \frac{e^{i\Delta kL} - 1}{i\Delta k},
\end{equation}
\\
\begin{equation}
  A_{Sig} = -\frac{i\epsilon_{0}\omega_{Sig}q^{2}\gamma_{e}^{2}}{2nc\rho_{0}}\frac{A_{P}A_{S}^{*}A_{Pr} + |A_{Pr}|^{2}A_{Sig}^{*}}{\Omega_{B}^{2} - \Omega^{2} + i\Omega\Gamma_{B}} \frac{e^{-i\Delta kL} - 1}{-i\Delta k}.
  \label{eq:Signal amplitude}
\end{equation}
\\
We focus on the signal amplitude given by Eq. \ref{eq:Signal amplitude}, noting that the second term in the numerator containing $A_{Sig}^{*}$ is very small and can be dropped,
\\
\begin{equation}
  A_{Sig} = -\frac{i\epsilon_{0}\omega_{Sig}q^{2}\gamma_{e}^{2}}{2nc\rho_{0}}\frac{A_{P}A_{S}^{*}A_{Pr}}{\Omega_{B}^{2} - \Omega^{2} + i\Omega\Gamma_{B}} \frac{e^{-i\Delta kL} - 1}{-i\Delta k}.
\end{equation}
\\
Close to resonance, the denomenator of the middle term containing $\Omega$ can be approximated as,
\\
\begin{equation}
\Omega_{B}^{2} - \Omega^{2} + i\Omega\Gamma_{B} \approx \Omega_{B}(\Omega - \Omega_{B} + i\Gamma_{B})
\end{equation}
\\
giving
\\
\begin{equation}
  A_{Sig} = -\frac{i\epsilon_{0}\omega_{Sig}q^{2}\gamma_{e}^{2}}{2nc\rho_{0}}\frac{A_{P}A_{S}^{*}A_{Pr}}{\Omega_{B}(\Omega - \Omega_{B} + i\Gamma_{B})} \frac{e^{-i\Delta kL} - 1}{-i\Delta k}.
\end{equation}
\\
The intensity of the backscattered signal is given by the magnitude of the time-averaged Poynting vector, given by
\\
\begin{equation}
  I_{i} = 2n\epsilon_{0}c|A_{i}|^{2}, \qquad i = 1,2,3,
\end{equation}
\\
which produces
\\
\begin{equation}
  I_{Sig} = \frac{\epsilon_{0}^{2}\omega^{2}_{Sig}q^{4}\gamma_{e}^{4}}{4n^{2}c^{2}\rho_{0}^{2}}\frac{|A_{P}|^{2}|A_{S}^{*}|^{2}|A_{Pr}|^{2}}{|\Omega_{B}(\Omega - \Omega_{B} + i\Gamma_{B})|^{2}}\bigg|\frac{e^{-i\Delta kL} - 1}{-i\Delta k}\bigg|^{2}.
\end{equation}
\\
The squared modulus term containing $\Delta k$ can be reduced as
\\
\begin{gather}
  \bigg|\frac{e^{-i\Delta kL} - 1}{-i\Delta k}\bigg|^{2} = \frac{(e^{-i\Delta kL} - 1)(e^{i\Delta kL} - 1)}{(\Delta k)^{2}} = \frac{L^{2}}{(\Delta kL)^{2}}\Bigg[ 2 - 2\Bigg(\frac{e^{i\Delta kL} + e^{-1\Delta kL}}{2}\Bigg)\Bigg] \notag \\ \notag \\
  = \frac{2L^{2}(1 - cos\Delta kL)}{(\Delta kL)^{2}} = \frac{4L^{2}sin^{2}\big(\frac{\Delta kL}{2}\big)}{\big(\Delta kL\big)^{2}} = \frac{L^{2}sin^{2}\big(\frac{\Delta kL}{2}\big)}{\big(\frac{\Delta kL}{2}\big)^{2}} = L^{2}sinc^{2}\bigg(\frac{\Delta kL}{2}\bigg)
\end{gather}
\\
and the denomenator containing $\Omega$ may be evaluated to produce
\\
\begin{equation}
  I_{Sig} = \frac{\epsilon_{0}^{2}\omega^{2}_{Sig}q^{4}\gamma_{e}^{4}}{4n^{2}c^{2}\rho_{0}^{2}}\frac{|A_{P}|^{2}|A_{S}^{*}|^{2}|A_{Pr}|^{2}}{\Omega_{B}^{2}\Gamma_{B}}\frac{\Gamma_{B}}{(\Omega_{B} - \Omega)^{2} + \Gamma_{B}^{2}}L^{2}sinc^{2}\left(\frac{\Delta kL}{2}\right),
\end{equation}
\\
where we have multiplied top and bottom by $\Gamma_{B}$ to recognize the form of a Lorentzian. Since $\Gamma_{B}$ represents the FWHM, we modify the $\Gamma_{B}$ terms in the Lorentzian to reflect this and adopt the more physically meaningful three-parameter Lorentzian function,
\\
\begin{equation}
  I_{Sig} = \frac{\epsilon_{0}^{2}\omega^{2}_{Sig}q^{4}\gamma_{e}^{4}}{4n^{2}c^{2}\rho_{0}^{2}}\frac{|A_{P}|^{2}|A_{S}^{*}|^{2}|A_{Pr}|^{2}}{\Omega_{B}^{2}\Gamma_{B}}\frac{\left(\frac{\Gamma_{B}}{2}\right)^{2}}{(\Omega_{B} - \Omega)^{2} + \left(\frac{\Gamma_{B}}{2}\right)^{2}}L^{2}sinc^{2}\left(\frac{\Delta kL}{2}\right).
\end{equation}
\\
Finally, we evaluate the optical fields as
\\
\begin{equation}
  I_{Sig} = \frac{\epsilon_{0}\omega^{2}_{Sig}q^{4}\gamma_{e}^{4}}{8n^{3}c^{3}\rho_{0}^{2}}\frac{I_{P}|A_{S}^{*}|^{2}|A_{Pr}|^{2}}{\Omega_{B}^{2}\Gamma_{B}}\frac{\left(\frac{\Gamma_{B}}{2}\right)^{2}}{(\Omega_{B} - \Omega)^{2} + \left(\frac{\Gamma_{B}}{2}\right)^{2}}L^{2}sinc^{2}\left(\frac{\Delta kL}{2}\right)
\end{equation}
\\
\begin{equation}
  I_{Sig} = \frac{\omega^{2}_{Sig}q^{4}\gamma_{e}^{4}}{16n^{4}c^{4}\rho_{0}^{2}}\frac{I_{P}I_{S}|A_{Pr}|^{2}}{\Omega_{B}^{2}\Gamma_{B}}\frac{\left(\frac{\Gamma_{B}}{2}\right)^{2}}{(\Omega_{B} - \Omega)^{2} + \left(\frac{\Gamma_{B}}{2}\right)^{2}}L^{2}sinc^{2}\left(\frac{\Delta kL}{2}\right)
\end{equation}
\\
\begin{equation}
  I_{Sig} = \frac{\omega^{2}_{Sig}q^{4}\gamma_{e}^{4}}{32\epsilon_{0}n^{5}c^{5}\rho_{0}^{2}}\frac{I_{P}I_{S}I_{Pr}}{\Omega_{B}^{2}\Gamma_{B}}\frac{\left(\frac{\Gamma_{B}}{2}\right)^{2}}{(\Omega_{B} - \Omega)^{2} + \left(\frac{\Gamma_{B}}{2}\right)^{2}}L^{2}sinc^{2}\left(\frac{\Delta kL}{2}\right)
\end{equation}
\\
The acoustic wavevector, $q$, can be written in more convenient terms of the frequency, $\Omega$, and sound speed, $v_{s}$,
\\
\begin{equation}
  I_{Sig} = \frac{\omega^{2}_{Sig}\Omega^{4}\gamma_{e}^{4}}{32\epsilon_{0}n^{5}v_{s}^{4}c^{5}\rho_{0}^{2}}\frac{I_{P}I_{S}I_{Pr}}{\Omega_{B}^{2}\Gamma_{B}}\frac{\left(\frac{\Gamma_{B}}{2}\right)^{2}}{(\Omega_{B} - \Omega)^{2} + \left(\frac{\Gamma_{B}}{2}\right)^{2}}L^{2}sinc^{2}\left(\frac{\Delta kL}{2}\right),
\end{equation}
\\
and the signal frequency, $\omega_{Sig}$, can be expressed in terms of the speed of light, $c$, and the material refractive index, $n$, simplifying the expression slightly to
\\
\begin{equation}
  I_{Sig} = \frac{\Omega^{4}\gamma_{e}^{4}}{32\epsilon_{0}n^{3}v_{s}^{4}c^{7}\rho_{0}^{2}}\frac{I_{P}I_{S}I_{Pr}}{\Omega_{B}^{2}\Gamma_{B}}\frac{\left(\frac{\Gamma_{B}}{2}\right)^{2}}{(\Omega_{B} - \Omega)^{2} + \left(\frac{\Gamma_{B}}{2}\right)^{2}}L^{2}sinc^{2}\left(\frac{\Delta kL}{2}\right).
\end{equation}
\\
Having already made the assumption of being close to resonance ($\Omega \approx \Omega_{B}$), we allow the $\Omega$ and $\Omega_{B}$ terms to cancel, leaving
\\
\begin{equation}
  I_{Sig} = \frac{\Omega^{2}\gamma_{e}^{4}}{32\epsilon_{0}n^{3}v_{s}^{4}c^{7}\rho_{0}^{2}\Gamma_{B}}I_{P}I_{S}I_{Pr}\frac{\left(\frac{\Gamma_{B}}{2}\right)^{2}}{(\Omega_{B} - \Omega)^{2} + \left(\frac{\Gamma_{B}}{2}\right)^{2}}L^{2}sinc^{2}\left(\frac{\Delta kL}{2}\right).
\end{equation}
\\
We now simplify this expression as
\\
\begin{equation}
  I_{Sig} = G_{CoBS}I_{P}I_{S}I_{Pr}L^{2}sinc^{2}\left(\frac{\Delta kL}{2}\right),
\end{equation}
\\
where we have defined $G_{CoBS}$ to be the gain term for this 4-wave mixing coherently stimulated Brillouin scattering process,
\\
\begin{equation}
  G_{CoBS} = g_{0}\frac{\left(\frac{\Gamma_{B}}{2}\right)^{2}}{(\Omega_{B} - \Omega)^{2} + \left(\frac{\Gamma_{B}}{2}\right)^{2}},
\end{equation}
\\
with $g_{0}$ given by
\\
\begin{equation}
  g_{0} = \frac{\Omega^{2}\gamma_{e}^{4}}{32\epsilon_{0}n^{3}v_{s}^{4}c^{7}\rho_{0}^{2}\Gamma_{B}}.
\end{equation}
\\
To find the power of the backscattered signal, we would integrate this intensity over the effective area. Approximated for fiber as a uniform circular mode of area $\pi r^{2}$, where r is the effective mode field radius, gives
\\
\begin{equation}
  P_{Sig} = \pi r^{2}G_{CoBS}I_{P}I_{S}I_{Pr}L^{2}sinc^{2}\left(\frac{\Delta kL}{2}\right).
\end{equation}
